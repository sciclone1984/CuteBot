# CuteBot
This is a repository for a discord bot I wrote that posts images of animals on command. I made it using the [TinyFox API](https://tinyfox.dev), which is the source for all the images. If you'd like to add it to your own server, you can do so [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=969093006512754728&permissions=277025410048&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Usage
After adding the bot to your server, you can use the following commands:

### !picture
Displays a picture of a selected animal.  Example:

```!picture <animal>```
